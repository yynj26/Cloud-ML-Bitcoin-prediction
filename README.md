# Cloud-Native Analytics Application: Predicting Bitcoin Cash on GCP

### About the project
This is the Final Project for MSDS434 Analytics System. In this project, I constructed a continuous Cloud-based ML pipeline with Cloud Run and Cloud Build, implemented as a interactive Flask application for Bitcoin Cash price prediction on given date.
                       
The cloud-native architecture ensures the pipeline is both scalable and flexible to changes, accommodating increases in user traffic or computational needs without requiring manual intervention. This implementation serves as a foundation for more complex ML projects, where computational demand and data volume escalate rapidly.

### Built With
