# Cloud-Native Analytics Application: Predicting Bitcoin Cash on GCP

### About the project
This is the Final Project for MSDS434 Analytics System. In this project, I constructed a continuous Cloud-based ML pipeline with Cloud Run and Cloud Build, implemented as a interactive Flask application for Bitcoin Cash price prediction on given date.                   
The cloud-native architecture ensures the pipeline is both scalable and flexible, accommodating increases in user traffic or computational needs without requiring manual intervention. This approach serves as a robust foundation for more complex machine learning or neural network projects, where computational demand and data volume can escalate rapidly.                      
Furthermore, using a cloud-based pipeline paves the way for easier application scaling, making it highly adaptive to the ever-changing landscape of data analytics and prediction. In essence, a cloud-based ML pipeline offers a powerful, future-proof solution for delivering sophisticated analytics services.
